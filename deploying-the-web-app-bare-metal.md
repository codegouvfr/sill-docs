# âš’ Deploying the web App (Bare metal)

This are the instructions for deploying the web app "bare metal", without Helm, Kubernetes and Docker, just running the web app on a Debian machine.  \
\
Unlike the guide for deploying on Kubernetes where we deploy the SILL at the root of a domain, `sill.code.gouv.fr`, in this guide we deploy under a sub path: `code.gouv.fr/sill`.

In this section we make the following assumption: &#x20;

*   You have a Keycloak server running somewhere. You have

    * It's URL. E.g: `https://auth.code.gouv.fr/auth`)&#x20;
    * The password of the 'admin' user.&#x20;

    Refer to [this section](deploying.md#installing-keycloak) if you're not there yet.
*   You have a sill-data git repository setup. You have:

    * It's address, E.g: `git@github.com:codegouvfr/sill-data.git`
    * The credential of a user that have push permition on this repo. E.g:&#x20;
      * name: `id_edxxxxxx`
      * private key: `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nAxxxx\nxxxx\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n`
    * (Optional): The web hook secret that enables to subscribe to to update event.

    If you're not there yet you can refere to [the instructions related to seting up the git database](deploying.md#the-git-based-database) through out this guide.
*   You own the domain code.gouv.fr and you have registered the DNS recod:

    `code.gouv.fr A <The public IPv4 of your Debian server>`
